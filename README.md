# CoreJavaProblemStatements
ProblemStatement-1 : 
Create class box and box3d. box3d is extended class of box. The above
two classes going to pull fill following requirement ™M Include constructor. TM
set value of length, breadth, height ™M Find out area and volume
Note: Base class and sub classes have respective methods and instance
variables.


Problem Statement - 2 :
Create class Number with only one private instance variable as a double
primitive type. To include the following methods (include respective
constructors) isZero(), isPositive(), isNegative( ), isOdd( ), isEven(),
isPrime(), isAmstrong() the above methods return boolean primitive type.
getFactorial(), getSqrt(), getSqr(), sumDigits(), getReverse() the above
methods return double primitive type. void listFactor(), void dispBinarv0.


problem Statement - 3:
Write a program to create a class named shape. In this class we have three
sub classes circle, triangle and square each class has two member function
named draw () and erase (). Create these using polymorphism concepts.

Problem Statement - 4:
Write a program to find the solution for the following problems using
Recursion.
i) Find the maximum of an array. Let all be an array of integers. if n=
afO] is the only number in the array and so, maximum = a[O]. if n > 1
then do the following: find the maximum of n-1 entries of the array.
Compare this maximum with the last entry a[n-11 and finalize.
) Find the Fibonacci numbers are defined as F0=1.F1=1 and Fi=Fi-1+Fi-2
fori>2.


Problem Statement - 5:
i) Write a program that will
- append 2 List of Students collections
- and make sure the appended list has only unique objects (by value)
i) write a program that will
- Search a arraylist of students, for matching firstname and lastname
5
Show case with for loop and iterator option


Problem Satement - 6 :

students id as kev and students objects as value. And perform following
action
fetch students objects based on supplied key (students id)
search students value(s) based on name and email
sort the students objects values based on name and email


Problem Statement - 7 :
